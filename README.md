# -Decoding-the-Buy-Box-A-Visual-Deep-Dive-into-Amazon-s-Sales-Dynamics
An interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing regional trends, profit margins, and category-level performance to drive actionable insights in Amazon's retail operations.

📌 Project Objective
This project aims to translate raw transactional sales data into meaningful, interactive visuals that help uncover insights about product profitability, sales channels, regional performance, and discount impact. Designed for business analysts, category managers, and retail strategists, the dashboard answers:
What drives Amazon’s revenue, and where can profitability be optimized?

📊 Insights & Business Recommendations
🔹 Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest total revenue (~40M), but Cosmetics dominates profits globally — this signals a high-margin category that should be prioritized.

🔹 Online channel generates 58.14% of total sales, but offline continues to play a strong role in profit-heavy segments like Office Supplies.

🔹 Fruits and Snacks consistently underperform in both revenue and profit — consider discontinuation or marketing rework.

🔹 There’s no consistent positive impact of discounting on unit sales — optimize pricing models and limit over-discounting in East Asia and MENA regions.

🔹 Order Priority Analysis shows 'High Priority' orders contribute disproportionately to profits — ideal for upselling bundles.
